I suppose that entails glowing pale blue and floating back and forth. (What else would a ghost do, anyway?)</p>\n<p>The man in the moon, however, is a rather frightful fellow. He&#8217;ll bare his teeth about once in every five lightning strikes, and then some if you aren&#8217;t being wary. (Mwa-ha-ha-ha!)</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re feeling brave, you can summon extra lightning strikes by clicking anywhere on the screen.</p>\n<p>Believe it or not, everything in this animation is an HTML element! The effects and animations are produced by CSS filters and CSS keyframe animations. The window and moon are HTML elements styled with CSS properties. JavaScript is used to randomize various aspects of the scene, such as the positions of ghosts, raindrops, and clouds. jQuery is the JavaScript framework used for DOM manipulation.</p>\n<p>What follows are some notable techniques I used to create this spooky scene.</p>\n</section><section id=staggered-entrances-varying-speeds><h2><a href=#staggered-entrances-varying-speeds class=anchor>Staggered Entrances, Varying Speeds</a></h2>\n<p>At the beginning of the animation, all of the ghosts, clouds, and raindrops are hidden off screen. Some show up almost immediately, while others wait a while before entering.</p>\n<p>It takes a while for all the particles to show up at the same time, and that is the work of the following JavaScript/jQuery code.</p>\n<pre><code>/* Add lots of .rain elements to the .window, with randomized horizontal positions, entry times and animation speeds. */\nfor(var i = 0; i &lt; 70; i++){\n    $(\"&lt;div&gt;\")\n        .addClass(\"rain\")\n        .css({\n            \"left\": random(-10, 100) + \"%\",\n            \"animation-delay\": random(18) + \"s\",\n            \"animation-duration\": random(2.4, 3.2) + \"s\"\n        })\n        .appendTo($(\".window\"));\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When the particles are generated, their <code>animation-delay</code> and <code>animation-duration</code> properties are initialized with random values. It can take anywhere from 0 to 18 seconds for a raindrop to start animating, and anywhere from 2.4 to 3.2 seconds for the raindrop to complete its fall. (Similar code is used when generating the ghosts and clouds.)</p>\n<p>The staggered entrances as defined by the randomized <code>animation-delay</code> property help to keep ghosts and particles uniformly distributed throughout the screen. The randomized <code>animation-duration</code> ensures that their positions relative to each other are not constant throughout the animation; if all the raindrops completed their animation cycles at the same time, they would form the exact same pattern on the next animation cycle, which would look quite odd.</p>\n<p>You can see the staggering and randomization described above more clearly in this modified animation. Ghosts are made more visible and won&#8217;t go off screen. Also, raindrops and clouds are not clipped inside the window area, so you can see where they are at the beginning of the animation.</p>\n<p>[ka_cs id=&#8221;5718630956335104&#8243;]</p>\n</section><section id=outside-or-inside-the-window><h2><a href=#outside-or-inside-the-window class=anchor>Outside Or Inside The Window?</a></h2>\n<p>As you probably noticed from the modified animation above, the positions of the clouds and raindrops can sometimes move outside of boundaries of the window. How are they being constrained?</p>\n<p>The way the HTML is structured, the moon, clouds, and raindrops are <em>child</em> elements of the window element.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"window-wrapper\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"window\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"moon\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"rain\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"rain\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        ...\n        &lt;div class=\"cloud\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"cloud\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        ...\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If not for the window&#8217;s <code>overflow</code> property being set to <code>hidden</code>, the rain and cloud particles would appear to be <em>inside</em> the house. As you saw, that totally ruins the illusion!</p>\n<p>[fig src=&#8221;Haunted Stormy Night &#8211; Window Overflow&#8221;]</p>\n</section><section id=lightning-flash><h2><a href=#lightning-flash class=anchor>Lightning Flash</a></h2>\n<p>Two CSS properties are used to simulate a lightning flash effect: <code>background-color</code> and <code>box-shadow</code>.</p>\n<p>During a lightning flash, the sky (or the window element&#8217;s background) turns white. The background color of the page also lightens.</p>\n<p>The magical final touch is a huge white drop shadow applied to the window via its <code>box-shadow</code> property. This gives the window an electrifying glow whenever the lightning strikes.</p>\n<pre><code>@keyframes LightningShadowLargeWhite {\n    10% { box-shadow: #fff 0 0 200px; }\n}\n</code></pre>\n</section><section id=pale-blue-ghosts><h2><a href=#pale-blue-ghosts class=anchor>Pale Blue Ghosts</a></h2>\n<p>The avatar images aren&#8217;t ghost-colored out of the box, but I can use a combination of CSS filters to make them so!</p>\n<pre><code>.ghosts {\n    filter: sepia(1) saturate(2) hue-rotate(150deg)\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>These filters allow you to apply a blue tint to an element.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>sepia(1)</code> reduces the color palette to only use shades of brown. Sepia photo filters are commonly used to simulate the look of an old photograph.</li>\n<li><code>saturate(2)</code> boosts the image to make the colors appear more vivid and bright, hence the &#8220;pale&#8221; in  pale blue ghosts.</li>\n<li><code>hue-rotate(150deg)</code> rotates the color wheel from the warm, orange-brown shades of the sepia filter to light blue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can change the degree value inside of <code>hue-rotate()</code> for a different tint color. By applying the <code>sepia()</code> and <code>hue-rotate()</code> filters together, you can tint an image using any color you want, regardless of what colors appear in the original image.</p>\n</section><section id=simultaneous-animations-two-layers-of-opacity><h2><a href=#simultaneous-animations-two-layers-of-opacity class=anchor>Simultaneous Animations, Two Layers of Opacity</a></h2>\n<p>The avatars, being ghosts for tonight, fade in and out of sight, so they are often quite difficult to see. They are more clearly illuminated, however, when lightning strikes.</p>\n<p>The regular fading in and out and the lightning strike &#8220;illumination&#8221; run as two separate keyframe animations, and they both use the <code>opacity</code> property. How are they able to run simultaneously, without one interfering with the other?</p>\n<p>The answer: one of the animations, <code>Ghost</code>, is applied to the ghost, and the other <code>LightningOpacity</code>, is applied to a common parent element of all ghosts, <code>.ghosts</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;div class=\"ghosts\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"ghost-wrapper\"&gt;\n        &lt;img class=\"ghost\" src=\"...\"&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"ghost-wrapper\"&gt;\n        &lt;img class=\"ghost\" src=\"...\"&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    ...\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>body.lightning .ghosts {\n    animation-name: LightningOpacity;\n    animation-duration: 1.2s;\n}\n.ghost-wrapper {\n    animation-name: Ghost, OscillateY;\n    animation-iteration-count: infinite;\n}\n.ghost {\n    animation-name: BackAndForth, OscillateRotate;\n    animation-timing-function: linear, ease-in-out;\n    animation-iteration-count: infinite;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>A similar technique is used to allow the ghosts to both rotate back and forth and bob up and down at the same time. <code>OscillateY</code> is applied to the ghost&#8217;s parent element, <code>.ghost-wrapper</code>, while <code>OscillateRotate</code> is applied to the ghost image itself.</p>\n<p>Add all of the above to <code>BackAndForth</code> animation, which uses the <code>left</code> property combined with absolute positioning, and each ghost will have up to 5 keyframe animations acting on it simultaneously at any given time. <em>And</em> they&#8217;re all staggered, <em>and</em> they vary in duration!</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll bet you all of my Halloween candy that no two runs of this animation will ever be alike.</p>\n</section><section id=contest-scary-jquery><h2><a href=#contest-scary-jquery class=anchor>Contest: Scary jQuery</a></h2>\n<p>This project was a <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/results-for-contest-scary-jquery/4954176688357376\">winning entry</a> to Khan Academy&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/contest-scary-jquery/4838853354061824\">Scary jQuery contest</a>, which ran from October 16th to November 2nd, 2015.</p>\n<p>If you learned something new from this post, let me know in the comments!

It delivers a top-notch experience, and it&#8217;s even grown from sustainable, 100% organic SVG sources!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Avatar-In-A-Box is truly the next revolutionary breakthrough in avatar technology. Now you can study your avatar from the inside out and obtain a full perspective of its structure simply by waving your mouse!</p>\n<p>In each and every step of the manufacturing process, we consistently meet or exceed industry best practices. We source our SVG Avatars from trusted local sources such as the <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/darrylyeo\">Khan Academy Avatar Picker</a>, where they evolve and develop, free-range.</p>\n<p>[fig src=&#8221;Khan Academy Avatar Picker&#8221;]</p>\n<p>Each SVG Avatar is then minimally processed through the <a href=\"/svg-to-processing-js-converter\">SVG to Processing.js Converter</a>. This highly refined procedure turns all SVG <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> components to their corresponding Processing.js shape commands, i.e. <code>beginShape()</code>, <code>vertex()</code>, <code>bezierVertex()</code>, and <code>endShape()</code>.</p>\n<p>To enable our revolutionary avatar technology, we modified the <code>beginShape()</code> and <code>endShape()</code> functions. This allowed us to draw a thin rectangle around each layer and apply 2D transformations.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"js\">var currentShape = 0;\n\nvar BeginShape = function(){\n    currentShape++;\n\n    var distanceFromCenter = map(currentShape/numberOfShapes, 0, 1, -1, 1) + 0.01;\n\n    pushMatrix();\n        if(dancing){\n            rotate(distanceFromCenter * 6 * sin(frameCount * 8));\n        }\n        translate(\n            mouseDistance.x * distanceFromCenter,\n            mouseDistance.y * distanceFromCenter\n        );\n        scale(0.4);\n        pushStyle();\n        noFill();\n        strokeWeight(3);\n        stroke(avatars[avatar][1]);\n        rectMode(CENTER);\n        rect(0, 0, 614, 614);\n        popStyle();\n        beginShape();\n}, EndShape = function(){\n        endShape();\n    popMatrix();\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each layer is translated and scaled such that the layers are arranged in pseudo-3D perspective, which varies based on the position of the mouse. This gives your Avatar-In-A-Box a pseudo-3D flair.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably noticed from the code above that a rotation is sometimes applied.

I played it along with my classmates that year at the concert and the culmination ceremony, and it was a hit! The performance by the eighth grade cadet band, however, was not as polished as it could be.

We had to substitute the alto and tenor saxophone parts with clarinets – a total of three clarinets. We also substituted the glockenspiel part with a keyboard.

You&#8217;re about to turn the page. You lift the page from the right and start turning it slowly. Then you stop when the page is perpendicular to the floor.</p>\n<p>Now you&#8217;re about to do the same thing to the page on the left. You lift the page and start turning it slowly. Then you stop when the page is perpendicular to the floor.</p>\n<p>If you consider all the 3D space that the two pages traveled through, you&#8217;ll notice that the volume takes the form of the front half a cylinder &#8211; a solid of revolution obtained by rotating a 2D shape around an axis.</p>\n<p>While we can&#8217;t fully construct a solid figure using wafer-thin pages, we can approximate it pretty closely by &#8220;fanning&#8221; the pages out. Each page is turned at its own angle, but there is enough that we can discern the overall shape.</p>\n<p>I used this approach to draw 3D eggs. But instead of rectangular book pages, I used pages that were shaped like half-eggs.</p>\n<p><dy-khan data-id=\"4665465301106688\"></dy-khan></p>\n<p>I started with one half-egg shape, or egg &#8220;slice&#8221;. Then I put another half-egg shape on top, but scaled down horizontally to simulate rotation. I kept overlaying egg &#8220;slices&#8221; at smaller and smaller horizontal scales until I drew a slice that was &#8220;rotated&#8221; 90 degrees. This process accounts for one side of the egg, so this is repeated for the other side.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m drawing 2D shapes on top of each other, but how do I achieve a three-dimensional appearance? By coloring each slice according to a color gradient. The hue changes very slightly from slice to slice; the more slices you make, the smoother the gradient becomes.</p>\n<p>As a final touch, I added a translucent white ellipse to make the eggs have a &#8220;shine&#8221;.

Let&#8217;s see how well my first logo fits with this philosophy.</p>\n<p>You might notice that this logo has just about every color of the rainbow. Every shape has its own color, and none are repeated. We have, in general rainbow order:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a dark red outline for the letter &#8220;D&#8221;</li>\n<li>a peachy orange triangle under the letter &#8220;Y&#8221;</li>\n<li>a golden yellow triangle inside the arms of the &#8220;Y&#8221;</li>\n<li>a grassy green fill for the letter &#8220;D&#8221;</li>\n<li>a sky blue background</li>\n<li>a bluish-purplish outline for the letter &#8220;Y&#8221;</li>\n<li>a magenta fill between the two letters</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I used 7 colors. Yes, that&#8217;s way more than you should use in a typical logo. But none of the tones stand out in particular – they are visually equal to each other. The triangles around the &#8220;Y&#8221; are lighter, while the fills and outlines of the letters are darker. The dark and light shapes cover equal amounts of area, which makes for a good balance.</p>\n<p>The inner shapes make up a square, which helps achieve a border effect. Because every element fills a part of this inner square, removing any element would disrupt the balance of the entire logo:</p>\n<p><dy-figure src=\"DY Logo Classic Unbalanced\"></dy-figure></p>\n<p>Not so iconic anymore, hmm?

The visuals are simple, largely based on the puzzle notation I invented when I was first brainstorming the idea, with orange lines around every transformer and a flag icon for the finish.</p>\n<p>I managed to program three or four levels with Scratch. But it proved to be really tedious after a while. Scratch doesn&#8217;t have much flexibility for dynamically created objects, and much less for storing level data. Everything in Scratch is a sprite you must manually create (at least in Scratch 1.0, the version that I used back then).</p>\n<p>The logic for color matching is based on the actual colors I used to paint the levels. All the red transformers, for instance are painted a certain shade of red. When the square touches this exact shade of red, it will transform to be red. You&#8217;ll notice that the flag is a lighter shade than the transformers&#8217; colors &#8211; when the square touches the corresponding lighter shade, that&#8217;s how the program detects that you&#8217;ve completed the level.</p>\n<p>I have not touched this project a single bit since I made it.

After I made the logo for <a title=\"KCI Productions Logo\">KCI Productions</a>, I realized the need to make a font API. The shapes making up the word &#8220;PRODUCTIONS&#8221; were hard-coded manually. And it&#8217;s no fun hard-coding every single letter whenever I need to display a word.</p>\n<p>And so I was inspired to make the MyFont API. It is used similar to the way you would call regular Processing.js <code>text()</code> functions.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>\n<pre><code>translate(200, 200);\r\n\r\nmyTextFont(funFont);\r\n\r\nmyTextAlign(CENTER);\r\nmyTextFill(100, 166, 255);\r\nmyTextSize(30);\r\nmyTextWeight(3);\r\nmyText(\"THIS IS DY'S FUN FONT!\", 0, -140);\r\n\r\nmyTextFill(0, 166, 25);\r\nmyTextSize(50);\r\nmyTextWeight(4);\r\nmyText(\"AWESOME!!!\", 0, -80);\r\n\r\nmyTextAlign(RIGHT);\r\nmyTextFill(100);\r\nmyTextSize(10);\r\nmyTextWeight(4);\r\nmyText(\"NOW WITH HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT!\", 180, -25);\r\n\r\nmyTextAlign(CENTER);\r\nmyTextFill(230, 26, 155);\r\nmyTextSize(20);\r\nmyTextWeight(3);\r\nmyTextTrailSpace(-2);\r\nmyText(\"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\", 0, 15);\r\nmyTextTrailSpace(2);\r\nmyText(\"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\", 0, 40);\r\nmyTextTrailSpace(6);\r\nmyText(\"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\", 0, 65);\r\n\r\nmyTextAlign(LEFT);\r\nmyTextLeading(currentMyText.size + 16);\r\nmyTextWeight(3);\r\nmyTextFill(50, 150, 120);\r\nmyText(\"WEIGHTS,\\nALIGNMENT,\\nTRAIL SPACE!\", -180, 100);\r\n\r\nmyTextAlign(RIGHT);\r\nmyTextLeading(currentMyText.size + 15);\r\nmyTextWeight(2);\r\nmyTextFill(200, 10, 250);\r\nmyText(\"SIZES,\\nCOLOR,\\nLEADING!\", 180, 100);\r\n</code></pre>\n<p>A &#8220;MyFont&#8221; is defined as a variable containing a set of functions. Each function makes function calls to Processing.js shapes, making characters. This allows for &#8220;custom-made&#8221; font faces that you can make using only code &#8211; and it can be much quicker than the traditional method of creating fonts. The <strong>Fun Font</strong>, the font I made for this demo, uses only <code>line()</code>s, <code>ellipse()</code>s, <code>arc()</code>s and <code>point()</code>s.</p>\n<p>Try changing up the function calls in the drawing code, and make a completely new font face of your own. You can only imagine the possibilities!</p>\n</section><section id=using-myfont><h2><a href=#using-myfont class=anchor>Using MyFont</a></h2>\n<p>To use a MyFont defined previously in the code, you call it like this: <code>myTextFont(funFont);</code> All function calls resemble the built-in Processing.js functions, but with the word &#8220;my&#8221; in front. So, <code>textSize()</code> and <code>textAlign()</code> would become <code>myTextSize()</code> and <code>myTextAlign()</code>. Just as in Processing.js, you can switch up the leading, trail space, and text alignment (just horizontally for now). It even supports multiline text with the use of the newline character, <code>\\n</code>.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the best part: since all of these shapes are created and rendered dynamically with normal Processing.js shapes, you have an infinite variety of font <em>weights</em>. This is not easily done with standard font formats, which is why this is so unique. The characters are simply made out of lines and strokes, so changing the font weight is as easy as changing the <code>strokeWeight()</code>!</p>\n</section><section id=try-the-fun-font><h2><a href=#try-the-fun-font class=anchor>Try the Fun Font!</a></h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a cool MyFont sampler I made.

This means that six coordinates of one curve change to be the corresponding coordinates of the other, then back again.</p>\n<p>This was a surprisingly easy effect, which I accomplished by adding a sine wave that takes a fraction of <code>frameCount</code> as its angle parameter. <code>frameCount</code> counts the number of frames that have passed since the start of the program, and increases by 1 each frame. As a result, the sine ratio changes, bobbing higher and lower with a nice easing as it reaches its minima and maxima. By adding or subtracting a sinusoid to each of the six coordinates, adjusting its sinusoidal axis and changing its amplitude to be the difference between the corresponding values, we can achieve this back and forth effect that appears natural and non-robotic.</p>\n<p>You can see this easing effect in almost every other aspect of the animation: bobbing the body of the runner up and down, changing the angle of the arms, and even waving the text back and forth in the background. Of course, it&#8217;s not the most perfect model for the motion of running, but it does the job without needing lots of variables to keep track of speed and acceleration.</p>\n</section><section id=stroking-strokes><h2><a href=#stroking-strokes class=anchor>Stroking Strokes</a></h2>\n<p>How did I get the stick figure to have a running outline all around? First of all, as you saw before, I used multiple shapes to draw different parts of the stick figure. Second, in Processing.js, you can&#8217;t stroke a stroked figure like <code>bezier()</code> in the first place!</p>\n<p>The trick is really simple &#8211; put all the shape drawing code into a function. All shapes must be stroked shapes, in this case <code>line()</code>s, <code>bezier()</code>s, and <code>point()</code>s.</p>\n<p>Then, call the function twice. Before each function call, change the stroke color and stroke weight with <code>stroke()</code> and <code>strokeWeight()</code>!</p>\n<pre><code>stroke(204, 167, 0);\nstrokeWeight(40);\nrunner(0, 0);\nstroke(243, 245, 171);\nstrokeWeight(30);\nrunner(0, 0);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Beats drawing custom filled shapes and having to stroke them!</p>\n<p>My <code>runner()</code> function already takes two parameters for the x and y position. For ease of use, I called <code>strokeWeight()</code> from within the <code>runner()</code> function and allowed a third parameter to pass it in.</p>\n<pre><code>stroke(204, 167, 0);\nrunner(0, 0, 40);\nstroke(243, 245, 171);\nrunner(0, 0, 30);\n</code></pre>\n</section>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Animated logo requested by <a href=\"http://www.khanacademy.org\" title=\"Khan Academy\" target=\"_blank\">Khan Academy</a> user <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/CandyExplorer\" title=\"Light Runner\" target=\"_blank\">Light Runner</a>, featuring translated Bézier curves, a simple trick to outline composite shapes, and a sinusoidal algorithm for the natural motion of running.</p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":121,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"projectDate":"2014-10-26 20:25:11","projectHeaderDarkMode":"false","projectHeaderColorScheme":"","kaId":"4754397843423232","scratchId":""},"categories":[2,4],"tags":[],"page-category":[32],"topic":[11,28,50],"language":[45],"tools":[24,31],"typeface":[21],"genre":[],"featuredImage":{"id":121,"alt_text":"Logo made for Khan Academy user Light Runner.","caption":"","description":"","media_type":"image","media_details":{"width":400,"height":400,"file":"2016/07/Light-Runner-Logo-1.png","sizes":{"thumbnail":{"file":"Light-Runner-Logo-1-150x150.png","width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image/png","source_url":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Light-Runner-Logo-1-150x150.png"},"medium":{"file":"Light-Runner-Logo-1-300x300.png","width":300,"height":300,"mime-type":"image/png","source_url":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Light-Runner-Logo-1-300x300.png"}},"image_meta":{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0","keywords":[]}},"post":94,"source_url":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Light-Runner-Logo-1.png"},"terms":[11,2,4,21,45,24,28,31,32,50],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-json/wp/v2/pages/94"}],"collection":[{"href":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-json/wp/v2/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-json/wp/v2/types/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-json/wp/v2/users/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-json/wp/v2/comments?post=94"}],"version-history":[{"href":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-json/wp/v2/pages/94/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-json/wp/v2/media/121"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-json/wp/v2/media?parent=94"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-json/wp/v2/categories?post=94"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-json/wp/v2/tags?post=94"},{"taxonomy":"page-category","embeddable":true,"href":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-json/wp/v2/page-category?post=94"},{"taxonomy":"topic","embeddable":true,"href":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-json/wp/v2/topic?post=94"},{"taxonomy":"language","embeddable":true,"href":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-json/wp/v2/language?post=94"},{"taxonomy":"tools","embeddable":true,"href":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-json/wp/v2/tools?post=94"},{"taxonomy":"typeface","embeddable":true,"href":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-json/wp/v2/typeface?post=94"},{"taxonomy":"genre","embeddable":true,"href":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/wp-json/wp/v2/genre?post=94"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https://api.w.org/{rel}","templated":true}]},"objectType":"post"},{"id":93,"date":"2016-07-04T12:06:45","date_gmt":"2016-07-04T19:06:45","guid":{"rendered":"http://darrylyeo.wpengine.com/?page_id=93"},"modified":"2017-05-09T18:04:27","modified_gmt":"2017-05-09T18:04:27","slug":"infinity-runner-logo","status":"publish","type":"page","link":"http://localhost:8888/darrylyeo/infinity-runner-logo","title":{"rendered":"Infinity Runner Logo"},"content":{"rendered":"<section id=\"top\"><p>A logo for a user named &#8220;Infinity Runner&#8221; would need to have something with an infinity symbol.

Lots of the code could be better written – much of the UI existed in the form of hard-coded numbers, and there were functions that ran all over the place, with no organization whatsoever! I decided that I wanted to make drastic improvements and completely revamp everything.</p>\n</section><section id=ninja-mode><h2><a href=#ninja-mode class=anchor>Ninja Mode</a></h2>\n<p>First order of business – &#8220;hiding&#8221; the program from my raving fans. All Khan Academy programs you make can be found via your Khan Academy profile. I didn&#8217;t want users to look at the new version until I was completely done. I call it &#8220;ninja mode&#8221;&#8230;</p>\n<pre><code>//Ninja Mode\ndraw = function() {\n    keyReleased = function(){\n        if(keyCode === ENTER){\n            frameCount = 0;\n            draw = function(){\n                draw2();\n            };\n        }\n    };\n    if(scaledMouseX &lt; 0){\n        draw = draw2();\n    }\n};\n\ndraw2 = function(){\n    // Main draw() loop\n};\n</code></pre>\n<p>What&#8217;s happening here? In Processing.js, the <code>draw()</code> function is the main program execution loop – the function that gets called once per frame. To start, the draw function doesn&#8217;t <em>draw</em> anything – it only checks to see if the <code>ENTER</code> key was pressed or if the <code>mouseX</code> position runs less than 0 (by dragging your finger left on a touch device). When that happens, the <code>draw()</code> function replaces itself with the function <code>draw2()</code>, which is where I put all my main execution.</p>\n<p>When someone comes to this program, all they&#8217;ll see is a blank white screen. I placed a bunch of line breaks at the beginning of the code, so they&#8217;ll also think the editor is blank. If any one of my raving fans happens to stumble upon this program, they wouldn&#8217;t think to scroll down in the code, or even press ENTER on the canvas!</p>\n</section><section id=revamping><h2><a href=#revamping class=anchor>Revamping</a></h2>\n<p>Over a few months I worked away at the code, changing data formats, making new functions, button classes, and so forth. The most apparent change from Version 1.0 to Version 2.0 is the new overall look. Here are just a few of the many changes I made:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The UI colors are more vivid, and the buttons have a sleeker look.</li>\n<li>The menus look more dynamic with a changing gradient background and circles that pop and fade out. It&#8217;s interactive, too – click anywhere to make a circle!</li>\n<li>The four central colors are less jarring to the eyes and play much better together.</li>\n<li>The typography was changed from Hoefler Text to Avenir (a font I see EVERYWHERE now).</li>\n<li>Level boards are no longer fixed at 20&#215;20 squares, and can shrink down to smaller sizes.</li>\n<li>Bricks and gates have been re-skinned, and the gates even have a cool sliding animation.</li>\n<li>Smiley now looks in the direction he moves in.</li>\n<li>The circles that pop out whenever Smiley transforms look much more elegant than the radar-looking ones from Version 1.0&#46; They can really add up if you transform too many times at once, so I added an option to turn it off under Settings (&#8220;Better Performance&#8221;).</li>\n<li>The level editor has been completely redone, and now it&#8217;s a much cleaner overall experience!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On February 19, 2014, I publicized Transcolors Version 2.0 to the Khan Academy community. Within a week it got to 66 votes, and two weeks later the total came to 167 votes. Two weeks after that, Transcolors 2.0 had 330 votes. The program ended up getting even more votes than the previous version!</p>\n<p>With a new update to a great game with fresh graphic effects and a beautiful new skin – not to mention all of the <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/transcolors-version-246-by-dy/2722008038?qa_expand_key=ag5zfmtoYW4tYWNhZGVteXJkCxIIVXNlckRhdGEiQXVzZXJfaWRfa2V5X2h0dHA6Ly9nb29nbGVpZC5raGFuYWNhZGVteS5vcmcvMTAxOTIzNDQ5NTcwNDI2NTQ0OTc5DAsSCEZlZWRiYWNrGICAgIConJkKDA\" title=\"Transcolors – Version 2.4.6 by DY: Tips and Thanks\">wonderful comments</a> I&#8217;ve received – several users made more <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/transcolors-version-246-by-dy/2722008038?qa_expand_key=ag5zfmtoYW4tYWNhZGVteXJvCxIIVXNlckRhdGEiTHVzZXJfaWRfa2V5X2h0dHA6Ly9ub3VzZXJpZC5raGFuYWNhZGVteS5vcmcvNmIyNjRiYmE2ODQ3ZmM2NTZlMjQwYjMxYjliYjBkNDUMCxIIRmVlZGJhY2sYgICAgPfPoQoM\" title=\"Transcolors 2.0 Custom Level Submittal Thread\">custom levels</a> for me, and it&#8217;s been a hit!

Color changes occur when the character steps on a blinking color transformer, upon which the old color is lost. The object of the game is to reach the flag with a matching color.</p>\n</section><section id=redesigning-the-puzzle-layout><h2><a href=#redesigning-the-puzzle-layout class=anchor>Redesigning the Puzzle Layout</a></h2>\n<p>The puzzles in the <a href=\"/transcolors/scratch\">Scratch version of Transcolors</a> are free-form and pixel-based; collisions are detected by touching pixels, using the pixel&#8217;s color to determine whether or not an obstacle is passable. Making levels is tedious, as they have to be hand-drawn with precisely chosen colors in order to make the game function correctly.</p>\n<p>I decided I wanted to improve upon this model. I first figured out that any free-form puzzle layout can be remade into a grid system, which would make the game logic much more efficient than checking the surrounding pixel color every time the player moved. It would also help to make the puzzles look consistent and easier to render.</p>\n<p>So I started by streamlining all the puzzle elements – the color transformers, walls, bricks, and gates – into a tile-based map. What used to be wide open space in the Scratch version is now constrained to &#8220;path&#8221; blocks. The character now simply moves from square to square.</p>\n<p>The player itself is a square in the Scratch version. That doesn&#8217;t work so well on a square grid, since you won&#8217;t be able to see where you&#8217;re standing. So I changed the shape to a circle; that way there&#8217;s some context as to what&#8217;s behind they player. And why not, let&#8217;s add a smiley face on top of that to make the game more fun.</p>\n<p>Thus begins Smiley&#8217;s debut – hello, Smiley!</p>\n<p>With a new tile-based system came a redesign of the puzzle elements. One thing I thoroughly enjoyed making was the brick-smashing animation. Simply run into a brick, and POW! – the whole thing explodes into pixels. If you think that&#8217;s satisfying, here&#8217;s the same animation on a much larger scale:</p>\n<p><dy-khan data-id=\"1676586086\"></dy-khan></p>\n<p>The tile-based system also brings a new objective to Transcolors: using as few moves as possible to finish a puzzle. Each time you step on a square, a counter increments to keep track of your moves. You&#8217;re also timed once the level starts, and your best move count and time are saved as high scores. I never programmed in the minimum possible amount of moves or any sort of time goal, so the main idea of this feature is to constantly improve your score after you try a level for the first time.</p>\n<p>Saving your hard-earned scores is a bit tricky, since there&#8217;s no way to store internal data in Khan Academy&#8217;s programming interface. Clicking &#8220;Save My Stats&#8221; from the main menu will output your scores as a JSON object, which you&#8217;ll have to override in the game code via copy-and-paste. You can then save the game code in its entirety to your Khan Academy account as a spin-off (or fork, if you will).</p>\n</section><section id=the-level-editor><h2><a href=#the-level-editor class=anchor>The Level Editor</a></h2>\n<p>Users can design their own level using the editor found under &#8220;Create a Level.&#8221; Just select a tile and a color from the palette, then drag on the game board to place tiles. Hit &#8220;SAVE&#8221;, and the game exports the code used to generate that level. Paste it inside the game code at the indicated spot, save a spin-off to your account, and you&#8217;ve just made your very own Transcolors level! You can even challenge your friends to solve it.</p>\n<p>Adding to that train of thought, why don&#8217;t I just let the Khan Academy community create some of the levels for me?</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/transcolors-version-172-by-dy/1553568203?qa_expand_key=ag5zfmtoYW4tYWNhZGVteXJqCxIIVXNlckRhdGEiTHVzZXJfaWRfa2V5X2h0dHA6Ly9ub3VzZXJpZC5raGFuYWNhZGVteS5vcmcvNmIyNjRiYmE2ODQ3ZmM2NTZlMjQwYjMxYjliYjBkNDUMCxIIRmVlZGJhY2sYob5JDA\" title=\"Transcolors 1.0 Custom Level Submission Thread\">created a post in the project discussion area</a>, where community members can submit links to spin-offs containing levels they&#8217;ve created. I would then review it and provide some feedback if necessary. If I feel that a level is deserving to be in the game*, I&#8217;d include it as an official level with credit to the maker. After the last Version 1.0 update, 13 of the 27 levels in the game ended up being made by community members. Not half bad.</p>\n<p>(*I&#8217;ve come to learn that level-making is a sort of art, and that it takes effort and some careful thinking to make levels that are effective. As such, I&#8217;m quite picky about style and don&#8217;t accept every level.)</p>\n</section><section id=reception-from-the-khan-academy-community><h2><a href=#reception-from-the-khan-academy-community class=anchor>Reception From the Khan Academy Community</a></h2>\n<p>Before long, Transcolors was rising up the ranks and eventually became the #1 most popular puzzle game of the Puzzle Game Challenge. (This was based on the order of which the spin-offs were listed – the challenge is entered by making a spin-off of the Puzzle-Game Challenge project. The ordering criteria was since changed to favor more recent projects, so presently Transcolors is &#8220;topped&#8221; by several other games – many of which aren&#8217;t of the puzzle genre, for the matter.)</p>\n<p>So, after using the concept of Transcolors from the Scratch game and remaking it with Processing.js, Transcolors became a huge hit, with over 500 up-votes from the Khan Academy community. I&#8217;m quite proud of this accomplishment, especially being so early in my JavaScript career!</p>\n</section><section id=transcolors-on-khan-academy-2-0><h2><a href=#transcolors-on-khan-academy-2-0 class=anchor>Transcolors on Khan Academy: 2.0</a></h2>\n<p>Of course, much was learned since the beginning of my JavaScript adventure.

Each block was painted in one of four colors: red, yellow, green, or blue. The blocks came in various shapes and sizes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a cube</li>\n<li>a short block – twice as tall as a cube</li>\n<li>a long block – three times as tall as a cube</li>\n<li>a short, flat block – like a &#8220;short block&#8221; halved the long way</li>\n<li>a long, flat block – like a &#8220;long block&#8221; halved the long way</li>\n<li>a triangular prism – has same volume as a cube</li>\n<li>a cylinder – twice as tall as a cube</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Usually I would assemble a fortress of crudely made fortresses. I would then make a catapult using a long, flat block as the arm and a cube and a triangle as the fulcrum. Then I&#8217;d load a red cylinder onto it, because it reminded me of dynamite, and then fire. It worked quite well – you could say I had quite a &#8220;blast.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Today was a little different. I started to make a maze out of the long, flat blocks. Just laid them on their side to make walls, and strung them together. Once I was done, I went through the maze, using a little cube as the main character.</p>\n<p>My little game grew from there. It became so that there were other little cubes in the maze, and when your cube passed them, it would switch to the color of that cube. And sometimes there were obstacles in your way, which you could remove by touching it with a matching color. Such removable barriers were represented by a long, flat block. And in other cases, some obstacles could levitate out of your way if you matched colors, but come back down once you switched again. I called these barriers &#8220;pillars&#8221;, and were represented by a short block on top of a cylinder. (The short block specified the color, because for whatever reason, the cylinders didn&#8217;t come in all colors.)</p>\n<p>Once these rules were set in place, I started building up the maze until it turned into a puzzle. The objective was to get to the end block, while matching its color.</p>\n<p>While we&#8217;re still on the topic: When you think about it, the concept is dead simple – matching colors. But is it always easy? Just play the second last level of <a href=\"/transcolors/khan-academy-2\">Transcolors on Khan Academy</a>, and you&#8217;ll see just how far this game went with a simple concept!</p>\n<p>I played my block maze over and over a few times, and it was really satisfying to play. Some games are more satisfying to play in the form of physical objects, don&#8217;t you think? Like, in the same way a video game about racing isn&#8217;t as satisfying as racing real cars on a real track, with real people and everything?</p>\n<p>Anyway, I didn&#8217;t want to lose all of my hard work. To make sure I remembered it, I wrote it down on paper using a special notation I made up, as shown at top.</p>\n<p>I made a few levels this way. I even shared my ideas with my friends and let them try it out, and they got the hang of it quite fast. The game seemed to be a great idea, one that I could maybe – just maybe! – turn into a real game.</p>\n<p>And so folks, that is how Transcolors was invented.</p>\n</section><section id=the-story-continues><h2><a href=#the-story-continues class=anchor>The Story Continues&#8230;</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"/transcolors\" title=\"Transcolors: A Colorful Puzzle Game\">Transcolors</a> entered the virtual world on three platforms: <a href=\"/transcolors/scratch\" title=\"Transcolors on Scratch\">Scratch</a>, <a href=\"/transcolors#khan-academy\" title=\"Transcolors on Khan Academy\">Khan Academy Computer Science</a>, and <a href=\"/transcolors/app\" title=\"Transcolors: The App\">iOS</a>.</p>\n</section>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I invented <a title=\"Transcolors: A Colorful Puzzle Game\" href=\"/transcolors\">Transcolors</a> in fourth grade.
